	Helferlein (/ˈhɛlfɐlaɪ̯n/; lit. 'Little Helper') are very small little programs (usually python or shell scripts with under 100 lines of source code) with short names (1-3 characters) that are meant to be symlinked into /usr/local/bin (or something comparable) and provide some shortcut to help do something in the command line with as few key strokes as possible (usually something that has to be done alot). You can view them as the big cousin of the alias, they fill a very similar role, but have a lot more possibilities. Some of them could basically just be replaced by alias, but I created them at some point and now I just don't have it in me to kill them (I do kinda picture them as some magical little fairylike creatures, flying around in my shell, helping me accomplish my tasks).<br />I have no idea, why you just read this text, but if you do find one of these cute little Helferlein helpful and improved it or you have one of your own that you think might fit the description, feel free to send me a pull request and I will happily add it.<br />The "External" directory doesn't contain any Helferlein, I just needed a place to put some useful scripts or tools by other people, that I use a lot, so they ended up there; just don't mind them.
